## 📦 Architecture

### Factory Pattern
- Permissionless basket creation
- Standardized deployment via BasktFactory
- Registry for discoverability

### Fee Mechanism
- Creator fees (incentivize basket curation)
- Protocol fees (sustainable development)
- Fee-in-shares model (maintains backing)

### Token Standards
- Full ERC-20 compliance
- Composable with other DeFi protocols
- Multi-token backing (up to 10 tokens per basket)

---

## 🚀 Deployment

**Live on Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet:**
- DApp: [baskt.io](https://baskt.io)
- Factory: `[0xdF0F069f46CEBA084bcc72CA435BDae01A2826bB]`
- Active Baskets: 1

**Mainnet Ready** - Contracts audited and optimized for production deployment
